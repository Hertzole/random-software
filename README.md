# RandomSoftware

Here's some random software I've created just to make certain tasks easier or automated. I thought I might as well open source them so I have somewhere to keep them.

### DuplicateLineFinder

Does what the same implies. It finds duplicate *lines* in a text file. Support for just showing you the lines, just removing the lines, or showing and then removing.

### SpotifySongMatcher

Takes a playlist and a folder location and does its best to match songs from that playlist with .mp3 files. If it matches, it will rename the file and add metadata from Spotify.
